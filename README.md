# Implementing-Latent-Dirchlet-Allocation
Topic modeling is the process of identifying patterns in text data that correspond to a topic. If the text contains multiple topics, then this technique can be used to identify and separate those themes within the input text. We do this to uncover hidden thematic structure in the given set of documents. Topic modeling helps us to organize our documents in an optimal way, which can then be used for analysis. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a topic modeling technique where the underlying intuition is
that a given piece of text is a combination of multiple topics.
The text document has some information aout NLP.
